        <p class="about-text">
            With a passion for technology that began with the first time using a computer as a child, I attended Niagara College for computer programming immediately after exiting high school. During my time there, I took the role of Design Lead on the Hospice Niagara Portal project, and then completed a co-op with Hospice Niagara to expand on its functionality to make it a perfect fit for them.

            When it comes to programming, I am a jack of all trades. Born and raised in Welland, Onatio. I am the part of the puzzle that bridges the vision of the architecture with the reality of the code. I look beyond the task at hand and attempt to find the most efficient solution to any problem.
